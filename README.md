Unless my Grassroots Economics team has a team project
I will work on a conservation financing project to protect old growth forests
It will tokenize ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration and allow them to be traded as for ex carbon credits
other ideas are an indiginous led community currency backed by future goods and services of economic development projects such as agriculture, aquaculutre, and tourism.
